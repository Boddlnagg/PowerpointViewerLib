# PowerpointViewerLib #
## PowerPoint Viewer 2003/2007 Controller ##

This is a C# library to control Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer from any .NET application. It is based on and internally using a modified version of a C++ library (`pptviewlib.dll`) originally created by the [OpenLP](http://openlp.org/) team for use in their open source church worship presentation software.

It does not (yet) work reliably with more recent versions of PowerPoint Viewer.

`PowerpointViewerDemo` is demo GUI to showcase the library's capabilities.
